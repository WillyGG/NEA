    TODO:
        - Statistical analysis of chances to be used by CC AI - run through a lot of games and graph the empirical data
        - find a way to abstract away the post/pre/in order traversals
	    - Test the implementation of the bust chances
	    - UPDATE BUSTCHANCE TO INCLUDE EVERYTHING IN RIGHT SUBTREE, AND NODES ABOVE, IF TURNING NODE IS IN LEFT SUBTREE and do the same for the exceed dealer chance.
	       - Greater than and less than card counts, create a new tree out of each node? Too inefficient?
